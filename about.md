I am cheerful lady with high spirits and positive mindset. I am from Peru and live in The Netherlands. I can be a workaholic sometimes, and I definitely enjoy travelling and visiting new places ... And I love my family!

Alex is my dearest husband, we married in 2002 and hope we will keep counting our years together. We promised to each other to be together at least for 999 years .... so many years to come yet!

Sebito is my little sweetie boy. He was born in 2005 and enjoys sports and reading.

Kalay is my little cutie princess. She was born in 2007. She adores soft toys and also likes to sport.

Well, of course I have more family in Peru. I will give you an impression of them in the pictures below  ... for a story, I will need another blog :-)
