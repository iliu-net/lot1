Since the beginning of my chemo in January, I have joined the physiotherapy sessions at the hospital. They have been really good so far. They have helped me to keep active and fit (at least a little bit) and introduced me to other ladies in a similar situation.

Every Monday and Thursday, I head to the physio - it has become a routine. On Monday, I drive myself to the hospital, it is a short 10m drive. On Thursday, Sylvia, my neighbour and friend (and also the mother of Sebito's best friend Jesse) takes me to the hospital. She is at my doorstep at 7:40am - with no delay, and waits for me patiently at the hospital's coffee shop while I exercise. She has been so kind and supportive all along, and I am truly glad she is around me at this time. Thanks a lot Sylvia!

Gabrielle is the physiotherapist. She diligently guides us through the whole training session and cheers us up to keep us motivated. We are 4 ladies in the physio.

"In the pocket" - this is a phrase I have got from Helene. She has a different kind of cancer (lymphoma, if I am correct). She is a very nice lady and always wears her long red-hair wig, Everytime I finish one session, I think to myself, "I have done it, in the pocket". It feels good to exercise, and hopefully, it is helping my body to keep on during the chemo treatment.

The other 2 ladies are Mieke and Miranda. Both of them had also breast cancer, and are fighting like me. We all have the same oncologist, Dr Oosterkamp, and we are following the same treatment. We share information, we discuss how we are feeling, and we encourage each other to keep going. It is really good.

The physio has brought us together. Four ladies in our forties, four mothers, four cancer patients. We all have big hopes that we will get over this period, and that we will get our good health back again!

<strong>Good luck to all of us!!! </strong>
