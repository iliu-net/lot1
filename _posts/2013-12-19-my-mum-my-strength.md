My mum is here with us. She has been here since October - for the second time this year! Not a planned trip, just one to support my family and me through this difficult period.

She has been my company during the radiotherapy treatment. We went together to the hospital every day, for 21 days. Same routine every day. Arriving to the hospital, parking in the 'free' area allocated to RC West, going to the Radiotherapy department, LINAC 5. Then, I would be called into the room for the 3-5m treatment, and then out again, where my mum would be waiting for me. I would be drinking water, lots of water, while my mum would be 'eyeing' the croquette at the hospital's restaurant. She had a few of them during this time, though, they are not very healthy! She knows but .... hmm ... that's my mum!

This is a nice picture we took today, while shopping at De Bijenkorf (a nice shopping mall in The Hague) ... we are enjoying the Christmas' spirits!

And of course, my mum has been doing most of the cooking at home. We have tried new recipes together - mostly Dutch ones. Yeap, we have prepared "Ewrtensoep" and "Boerenkool stampot' - amazing! My kids have been spoiled with the 'chaufu' that they like and my mum cooks when she thinks they are not going to eat the main dish (because there are too many vegetables ... well, this is mostly for Kalay) ... but she has also enjoyed the food prepared by "Chef Alex" as she calls my hubby (but watch out, Alex doesnt like to be called this way ... stop it mum!)

Though she is concerned about myself, she has always been positive. She tells me: "You will get through this, dont worry" and "this is just temporary ..." She is my mum, she knows me all my life, so I will believe her. I will get through this!!!

Love you MUM!
