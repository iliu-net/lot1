I finally cut my hair. The day I was dreading or fearing for months arrived. My hair was falling, more and more as the days passed by. It started on Monday 20 Jan with some hair falling off more than normal in the shower. By Saturday, hair was falling in huge amounts.... The shower, the wall, the sink were full of hair - like if I had been to a hairdresser! I lost all the hair at the sides of my head... It was awful!!!

It was time then. I could not wait any longer for this ... I was lucky to be released from hospital and able to go to my 'hairwerker' - a Dutch specialist hairdresser, her name is Lobke.

Alex and Cuche came with me. I first asked Lobke to cut the length of my hair with scissors..... I got a funny 'Cleopatra' look. Then, she started shaving my hair.

I got a bit emotional when she started shaving my hair and cried for a few seconds.... Cuche held my hand in support ... but then, I started thinking, OK, it is not nice but it is only my hair and it will grow back!!! And it will grow back stronger and more beautiful ... so no point on keep crying, calm down, it is a new beginning!

When Lobke finished shaving my hair, I took a glance at the mirror. surprisingly, I did not look too bad, my head is nicely round and somehow it looked cute (?!?) ... I felt myself being Sinead O'Connor .... Alex told me "I like it, you look cute".  It must be LOVE!

Then, Lobke started adjusting the wig to my new head. I chose a wig that looks very similar to my hair. I would say it is not exactly the same, I can see the difference - the children also! But it does its job.

This is the first picture with my new 'hairdo'. This is Leiden, and Cuche is next to me.

What do you think?
