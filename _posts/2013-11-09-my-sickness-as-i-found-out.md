I will never forget the day when I was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was a Tuesday, the date September 24th 2013.

The week before I had felt a lump in my breast, went to the GP to check it and she sent me to hospital. I was all scared, worried if it was malignant. The GP said there was 50/50 chance that the lump was a bad one. I was hoping all that week that it was not a bad one ... and was getting obsessed with the lump. My children noticed that and were asking me not to touch it! I told my sisters, my mum and my boss that I was going for a check at the hospital. I was hopeful that it was just a cyst ...

Alex was with me at the hospital when we heard the results. I had done a mammogram, ultrasound and a pathology exam through an injection in the the lump (or lumps, there were 2 that could be felt from the skin). The nurse called us to the room and told us "have they told you something? ... I am sorry you have breast cancer"

That was it. I was in shock, I asked "are you sure", "how come? " ... I couldnt believe it, but it was true. I had it. My fears turned to reality ... there was nothing I could do to change it.
