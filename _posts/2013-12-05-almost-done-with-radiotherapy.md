title: Almost done with Radiotherapy

Yes, almost done with it. Today, I had my 18th session out of a total of 21 sessions. It has been days of going to the hospital everyday to get 3-5min of radiation. Fortunately, the radiation itself does not hurt. The machine is big, a bit overwhelming, it goes round in all directions to ensure that all areas are radiated according to the schedule. I only hear this kind of "laser" sound and picture in my head that the rays are "killing" any cancer cell that comes on their way ... hopefully it is doing a good job!  And luckily, I dont feel any pain. My skin still looks OK for the number of sessions I have had .... and hope it remains as is for the coming days.
