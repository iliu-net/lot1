Today, I had my second appointment with the oncologist. I heard about the schedule of my chemo and was a bit shocked to find out that it is gonna take 24 weeks to complete it! Ok what I can do, just follow it. She says it is a preventive treatment, still it is quite strong and (potentially) full of side effects.

So I looked at my calendar and started counting the weeks .... when I start the treatment in January 2014, I will be finishing around my birthday in June. Then, I think I will have a good reason to celebrate, to party, to be happy! .... it is all I can think of now.
