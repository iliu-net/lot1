Today I had my first haircut after BC. My hair started growing after chemo ended 3 months ago. It is still very short but there were many fluffy hairs around and hair was growing in a messy way.

Lobke cut the ends and gave my hair some style, some shape &amp; form. A Starting point of a real haircut. My hair still needs more time to grow, but now it will hopefully grow better and nicer!

I just can't wait to have a proper haircut and take out my wig!
