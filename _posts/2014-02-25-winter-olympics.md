-->It has been 2 weeks of full adrenaline and excitement!

I have enjoyed watching the Sochi Winter Olympics. It was the first time that I had the chance to watch so many games and follow the superb Dutch Speed Skating Team. Now, I know what ice skating means to Dutch, and they are so good at it! 24 medals in this Olympic games, unbelievable! Sebito and Kalay also enjoyed watching their Team NL, they have already become little Dutch kids! ... Truly fun :-)

Olympics was so much of a distraction that I even had my third chemo watching one game at the hospital. That was on 19-Feb, Ladies' speed skating 5,000m race when Ireen Wust - the best Dutch female skater - won a silver medal. Really cool!

So already 3 cycles of AC done! So far, so good .... I am feeling fine, and of course, hope and pray that it stays good for the upcoming treatments!  Positive mindset!!!
