Hair started falling out on Monday. Slowly at the beginning, but going out fast as the days pass by.

I had the appointment with the haidresser to cut my hair today... But I am in hospital and had to cancel it! I have got high fever on Thursday night ... An infection due to my low defenses. Doctors have not found the cause of it yet

Opps.... Change of plans again! Doctor just came in and has released me from hospital!!!! I can go to the haidresser now .... New look on the way!
