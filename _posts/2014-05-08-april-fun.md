Thinking retrospectively, April was a month filled with family outings ... all good and fun. I felt really good through the month and had the fortune to enjoy the company of my dear family. It was a great month!!!

Through half of April I enjoyed the company of Cuche and Karen. Their last days in Holland, after a 3-month stay. I had the chance to show them a little bit more of NL, we went to places we have not even been before! Bonus for us also! Check out some pictures of these outings.

Then, it was "change of guards". Cuche and Karen left on 16-April and my mum arrived to NL on 18th, which was the Easter Good Friday. We have ventured to some other places and had good fun. Here below, some more pictures for your enjoyment and imagination.
