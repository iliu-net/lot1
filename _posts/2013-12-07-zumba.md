Zumba, zumba ... this really relaxes me!

I am very happy and proud that I joined the lesson today. The second time after my surgery. I danced, jumped, swinged, moved and simply enjoyed!

I always feel fresh, re-energised and happy when I am at the lesson. Monique (the instructor) is super good and vibrant. She dances very well, and I enjoy trying to follow her, trying to dance at the rythm of the latin songs, salsa, zamba, rock, all sorts of wonderful music.... not always easy, and am aware I get lost sometimes. But who cares, for me the most important thing is that I DO something I LOVE! And it helps me to keep FIT. What else I can ask :-)
