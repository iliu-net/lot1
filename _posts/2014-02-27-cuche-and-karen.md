Thanks Cuche and Karen for being in NL with us! It is a blessing for me and my family, I am extremely thankful for your help and company these days. I have learned a lot from you, I am starting to take a different perspective on many things in life .... and hope I can retribute back to you someday. Thanks from the bottom of my heart!
