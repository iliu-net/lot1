C - Day = Chemo Day

I have dreaded this day for long time ... finally it had to happen. Today was my first chemo session. In Dutch, they say 'chemo kuur'. I had a PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter) installed in my arm yesterday, which was very useful infrastructure. Via a device, the drugs are just connected and flow to the PICC, and then into my veins. No need of a neddle to find a vein!

This chemo consists of 2 type of drugs: A (Adryamicyn/ Doxorubicine) and C (Cyclofosfamide).  It took 15 mimutes for each drug plus 10-30 minutes of flushing with salt water. It seems all went in quite fast, I still feel fine. So now, it is waiting time to see any possible side effects during the next days ... which I hope they will NOT COME UP!!!
