Today Cuche and Karen left NL and returned to their US home. They spent 3 months with us, it seems time has passed by very fast!

Also, today I got my third Paclitaxel chemo. So far it has been fine, no major side effects - apart from tiredness .... fingers crossed it remains like this! So I have done 1/4 of the Paclitaxel treatment .... time is flying!
