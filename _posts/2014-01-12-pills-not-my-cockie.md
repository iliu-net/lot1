I have always had a trauma with swallowing pills ... since I was a little girl. Dont know why, but have never managed to get them through my throat first-time right and fast!

So I almost fainted, when I saw the BOX of pills that I had to take to prevent chemotherapy side effects during the first 5 days of treatment .... Literally, I had to take around 8 pills 2 hours before I start the chemo, and then many more, in the next days.

Luckily, my mum is here! She has this secret recipe and makes a starch/gel that makes swallowing pills much easier .... and it worked! First day, 8 pills, all taken ... next sessions, the same ... and now, I am proud to say that I have finished the BOX! And all boxes are ticked as evidence of completion (like SOX control .... )

Thanks a lot Mum, YOU ARE THE BEST!!!

And, hope I can keep it up for the next chemo treatments. I know I can ... but, I still need to learn my mum's secret recipe ;-)
