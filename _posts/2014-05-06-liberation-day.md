In the Netherlands, Liberation Day (Dutch: <span lang="nl"><i>Bevrijdingsdag</i></span>) is celebrated each year on May 5th to mark the end of the occupation by Nazi Germany during World War II.

I had my own "Liberation Day" on May 5th: I was released from hospital after a 4-day stay!!!

After receiving my fifth chemo of paclitaxel/taxol, I have got high fever and blood tests showed that I had a bacterial infection. I had to be admitted to hospital to be treated and get the fever down. At some point I had fever of 41.4c ... it was extremely high, never had that level of temperature before! I received antibiotics via IV, as well as lots of liquids and nurses were monitoring every hour. Luckily the fever started going down until it was completely gone - in a lapse of one day.

The doctors determined that the bacteria that was in my blood was "pseudonomas" and prescribed the required antibiotics' tablets. I hate taking pills!!! so this was another down on my journey ....

Fortunately, I have Alex, the kids and my mum :-) They were around to support me, they were all afternoons with me in the hospital making good company .... this is a blessing!

<strong>My conclusion</strong>: It is all very tricky with this chemo treatment and its huge impact on my immune system. I have to be careful about being in public places or near sick people, but still it is hard to know what I can or cannot do to prevent getting infections. I only hope I do not have more incidents like this until the end of the treatment.
