The count down to my last chemo has started! Yep, time is flying ...

Yesterday, I had my 8th Paclitaxel chemo session, which means I have 4 to go, yuupiiii! It has already been 20 weeks of treatment, with ups and downs, issues here and there. But, I survived. And now, the final line is in sight .... 4 weeks to go, and then DONE with chemo! I want to trust that everything will go fine in the weeks to come, no downs, no issues, no complications. Chemos on schedule, no delays. I will STAND in FAITH!!!

And tingling, please go away! I have been feeling tingling and itchiness in my feet, a bit in my hands during the last week. This is a common side effect of the Paclitaxel drug. The doctor reduced the drug doses from 120mg to 90mg yesterday, with the hope to reduce the tingling sensation of my feet and hands. Hope it works. I will STAND in FAITH!!!
