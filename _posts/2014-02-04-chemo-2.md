Yes, already my second chemo! I got it last Wednesday 29th and today is day 7 of chemo.

Day 7 is supposed to be the most critical day of the chemo cycle, when my immune system is at its lowest levels and I am more prone to catch an infection. I am being careful, just staying at home and taking things easy. Good thing is that I have been feeling fine so far, no complications, no major side effects ... I hope it will continue like this or even better in the next treatments!
