title: Last AC chemo
...
---

I had my fourth chemo last Wednesday 12-March. And this was the last one from the first part of my treatment, using the AC drugs!... and today, I took the LAST pill of the Antiemetica Box A, the last one of many pills I have taken in the last months!

Yupiiiiii another milestone in my journey! Now, I need to rest and recover for the next 2 weeks until the next phase of my treatment.

All the best to my body, to my spirit, to myself, family and friends in the Paclitaxel journey to come!!!
