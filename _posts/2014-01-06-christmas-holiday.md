Christmas was a joyful time with the family. Perfect to relax and have peace of mind.

We were visiting the Christmas markets in Dusseldorf. Many things to see and eat ... sausages, yami! It was a good weekend and the kids had a good time ice skating and going into all the merry-rounds.

Christmas' eve at home was a nice celebration. Plenty of food, and then plenty of presents for everybody. This year we ventured to see "The Nutcracker" ballet, for the first time with the whole family. It was a special Dutch version, the story was a bit different but still entertaining.

A long weekend in Landal Het Vennenbos was the last outing of the 'Kerstvakantie' (Christmas holiday in Dutch). Sebito and Kalay had big fun in the subtropical swimming pool, full of slides, well Alex too. My mum and I had time to walk in the park and get some fresh air. All very relaxing and enjoyable, until we returned home ... A nasty surprise awaited us. Burglars had broken into our house, taking money and jewelry and leaving the house in a mess ... horrible, I wonder why this happened? why? how?!?

This incident closed 2013 with a bitter feeling. I do not want to have another year like 2013. So I am moving on, we are now in 2014 and this year will be a much better one! It has to be!!!
