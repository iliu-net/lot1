All my family is in Peru this week. We had a big family celebration: <strong>Carolyn and Jean Marco's Wedding Day</strong>! The Big Day of my Little Sis, congratulations!!!

Alex, Sebito and Kalay flew over to join the wedding in Peru. They were very excited, well me too. Sebito and Kalay were in the wedding party, as flower boy &amp; girl together with my nieces and nephews. They look so cute in their dresses, so sweet, check them out:

I would have loved to be there, but unfortunately, I could not attend due to my treatment. So sad but that's how it is and had to accept it. At least, I had a chance to glimpse through the wedding party via Skype. The signal was not very good and the images were very blurry; but OK, better than nothing :-)

Alex and the kids are staying in Peru the whole week. They are enjoying their holidays and having lots of fun with their cousins. Good for them! I see you back in NL pretty soon, Love you!!!
