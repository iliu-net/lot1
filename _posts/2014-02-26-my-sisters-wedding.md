Alex, Sebito and Kalay flew over to join the wedding in Peru. They were very excited, well me too. Sebito and Kalay were in the wedding party, as flower boy &amp; girl together with my nieces and nephews. They look so cute in their dresses, so sweet, check them out:

I would have loved to be there, but unfortunately, I could not attend due to my treatment. So sad but that's how it is and had to accept it. At least, I had a chance to glimpse through the wedding party via Skype. The signal was not very good and the images were very blurry; but OK, better than nothing :-)

Alex and the kids are staying in Peru the whole week. They are enjoying their holidays and having lots of fun with their cousins. Good for them! I see you back in NL pretty soon, Love you!!!
