After nearly 1 year, I am back to work today. It was only 2 hours at the office, but still a milestone. It was a bit surreal, coming back to the same office, to my desk, seeing my colleagues. Mix of feelings and emotions: happiness, nervousness and excitement. It felt as if I had never left the place. Reality is I was out of the office for 11 months. I will reintegrate into working life in the next weeks and months. I have to take things slowly, step by step and thinking positively about the future. I am pleased that Shell and NL offered this chance of slowly re-integration, the company's support in all this period has been invaluable.

I must also say that I am back to my Blog. It has been 2 months of recovery, summer holidays and trying to get fit and re-energised.
