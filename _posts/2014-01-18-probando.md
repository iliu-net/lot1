Let op means "be careful".  The whole sentence reads "Be careful of the toilet, only Mama"

I have posted this sign in my bathroom during the first week of my chemo. Reason being that in that period I have lots of chemicals (cytostatica) in my body which can be dangerous to healthy people. The sign was very useful for my kids, it helps to remind them that they cannot use the toilet designated for me.

It worked well in the first round ... and hope it will work for the next cycles!
