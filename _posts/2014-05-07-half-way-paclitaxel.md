I had my 6th Paclitaxel chemo today, which means I am half way of this treatment. 6 more to go!

The journey has been a bit bumpy and hope it smooths out for the rest of the treatment. My PICC<em> (1)</em> line has been removed - for the second time! - after my bacterial infection last weekend. This was sad considering I have only got it 2 weeks ago. I am thinking if it would be better to continue the treatment without a PICC line .... as said 6 more chemo to go, so will see how it goes in the next weeks.

<em>(1) PICC = Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter is a form of intravenous access that can be used for a prolonged period of time (e.g. for long chemotherapy regimens, extended antibiotic therapy, or total parenteral nutrition). </em>Source: Wikipedia
