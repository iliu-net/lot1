Yup, I have finished, I have done it!

I had my last chemo yesterday Wed 18-June. It is over, and hope it is for good!!! I am very happy about it and looking forward to a full recovery! Thanks God!!!! and thanks to all my family and friends who have supported me in this difficult journey!

Next phase: hormonal therapy
